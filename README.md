Abstract:  Extracting numbers and letters from license plate images captured by traffic control cameras is an important task in an automatic plate recognition system. In this thesis, some methods are proposed to categorize the plate images based on the different lighting conditions. For each category, a special preprocessing stage and binary algorithm are suggested. To binarize images with shadow, a new algorithm is proposed which has the ability to remove the shadow effects. Furthermore, a binarization algorithm based on background estimation using the arithmetic mean filter is proposed which is able to binarize low contrast images, the images captured under uneven lightening conditions, and ordinary images. To remove binary noises provided through the binarization process, a method is proposed consisting of seven stages which have the ability to remove a large part of the noise and separate the numbers and letters which is attached to the frames. To validate the results obtained by the proposed algorithm, a database with four thousand images that contain different types of images has been employed. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.  Keywords: License Plate Images, Binarization Algorithm, Contrast Enhancement, Binary Noise removal.
