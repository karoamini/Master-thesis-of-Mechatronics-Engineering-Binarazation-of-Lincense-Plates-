Image binarization is the process of taking a grayscale image and converting it to black-and-white, essentially reducing the information contained within the image from 256 shades of gray to 2: black and white, a binary image. Generally, binarization is categorized as Global and Local [3]. Global binarization is the technique in which a single threshold value is applied to binarize the entire image. It is fast process but fails for the documents with complex background. In Local binarization technique instead of single threshold for the whole image, a different value of threshold is chosen for every pixel. The threshold is chosen depending upon the neighbourhood pixels.

In this part, different methods of binarization are implemented and then some of them are modified to get better results.
